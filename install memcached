#Installing RPM Files on Ubuntu (If Needed):
sudo apt update
sudo apt install alien
sudo alien -k epel-release-7-11.noarch.rpm
sudo dpkg -i epel-release_7-11_all.deb

Summary:
    On Ubuntu, you interact with /etc/memcached.conf instead of /etc/sysconfig/memcached.
    Use the service command to manage the Memcached service.
    Ensure you have Memcached installed via apt, not yum.

   After making changes to the configuration file, don't forget to restart the Memcached service:
sudo service memcached restart

  Then you can check if it's listening on the desired IP:

sudo netstat -tuln | grep 11211
